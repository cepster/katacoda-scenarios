Let's add a new feature. First we'll create a new feature branch

`git checkout -b feature1`{{execute}}

In this feature branch, let's create a new file

`touch bar.txt`{{execute}}

Let's also modify our original foo file

Then let's commit our changes

`git add .`{{execute}}

`git commit -m "Added feature 1"`{{execute}}
