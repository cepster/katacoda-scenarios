We are on the master branch in our new git repository. Let's create a file and add some history.

`touch foo.txt`{{execute}}

Feel free to edit the file in the above editor.

Next, we'll commit our changes. First we need to add the file to git for tracking.

`git add .`{{execute}}

Then we'll commit

`git commit -m "My first commit"`{{execute}}
